# nix-forensics (nfx) - live-response & DFIR toolkit for Linux and macOS

Small, single-purpose command-line tools for SOC / CSIRT investigators, in the spirit of
Eric Zimmerman's Windows tools: one artifact per tool, consistent flags, plain-text or CSV
output you can grep, diff, or drop into a timeline. Pure bash 3.2+ (the macOS default) with
no dependencies beyond what ships with the OS, so the checkout can be copied to a USB stick
or `scp`'d to a suspect host and run immediately.

Every tool is **read-only** on the host (the only writes are the output files you ask for)
and prints `[!] [TAG] ...` lines for things an analyst should look at. Flags are leads, not
verdicts; each tool ends with a recap of what it flagged.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amitrrajeshwarkar/the-ai-forensicator && cd the-ai-forensicator/nix-forensics
sudo bin/nfx-triage --case IR-2024-042           # everything, packaged as tar.gz + manifest
sudo bin/nfx-persistence --since 7d              # just one question
sudo bin/nfx-procs --csv > procs.csv             # machine-readable
sudo bin/nfx-diff baseline-dir/ suspect-dir/     # what changed vs. a known-good host
tests/smoke.sh                                   # verify the toolkit on this OS
```

Run as root for complete results (shadow, other users' homes, /proc/*/environ, TCC.db, journal).
Each tool supports `-h`, `-V`, `-o FILE` (tee output to a file) and `--no-color`.
Time windows use one syntax everywhere: `30m`, `12h`, `7d`, `2w` or `YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Typical workflows

**Live triage of a suspect host** (order of volatility is built in):

```bash
sudo bin/nfx-triage -d /mnt/usb/case-42-host01 --case 42 --since 14d
# -> case-42-host01/{sysinfo,procs,network,...}.txt, *.csv, raw/ copies, findings.txt,
#    manifest.csv (sha256 of every file), triage.log, and a .tar.gz with its own sha256
```

`--quick` skips the slower collectors (timeline, webshell, process hashing); `--full` adds a
whole-disk body file, hashes of every system binary, package verification and orphan detection.

**Hunt a specific TTP** across a fleet: each tool is independent, so the directory can be
pushed with scp/Ansible/Jamf and one tool run per host:

```bash
for h in $(cat hosts); do
  scp -rq nix-forensics "$h:/tmp/nfx" && ssh "$h" 'sudo /tmp/nfx/bin/nfx-persistence --no-color --since 7d' > "out/$h.txt"
done
grep -h '^\[!\]' out/*.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head      # fleet-wide view of flags
```

**Baseline and compare** a gold image against production:

```bash
sudo bin/nfx-suid --save gold-suid.txt                  # on the gold image
sudo bin/nfx-suid --compare gold-suid.txt               # on the suspect
sudo bin/nfx-triage -d gold/ --quick --no-tar ; sudo bin/nfx-triage -d prod/ --quick --no-tar
bin/nfx-diff --flags-only gold/ prod/
```

**IOC sweep** from a threat-intel report:

```bash
cat > iocs.txt <<X
185.220.101.5
update-cdn.example.net
5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592
kdevtmpfsi
/tmp/.x/
X
sudo bin/nfx-ioc -i iocs.txt --csv > ioc-hits.csv
```

**Timeline** around a pivot time, feed to mactime/Plaso if needed:

```bash
sudo bin/nfx-timeline --since 2024-05-01 /etc /home /tmp /var/tmp /opt > tl.csv
sudo bin/nfx-timeline --bodyfile / > host.body && mactime -b host.body -d > host-mactime.csv
```

## Design notes

* **One artifact, one tool.** Each script is under ~300 lines and can be read in a few minutes,
  which matters when you have to explain in court what the tool did.
* **Portable by construction.** bash 3.2 syntax only; GNU vs. BSD differences (`stat`, `date`,
  `find`, `ps`, `ls`) are wrapped in `lib/nfx-common.sh`. Epoch to ISO conversion is done in
  awk so timelines are fast without gawk.
* **Consistent output.** `====` headers, `---` sections, `[*]` info, `[-]` warnings on stderr,
  `[!] [TAG] message` findings, and a recap at the end. CSV modes use RFC 4180 quoting.
* **Findings survive pipelines.** Flags are appended to a temp file so counts are right even
  when raised inside `while read` subshells; the file is removed on exit.
* **No host modification.** Nothing is installed, no packages are touched, atime is only
  affected by reads (mount `noatime` or image first when that matters).

## Caveats

* Reading `/proc/*/environ`, `/etc/shadow`, other users' homes, `TCC.db`, the journal and
  `sfltool dumpbtm` needs root; macOS additionally needs **Full Disk Access** for the terminal
  running the tools to read TCC, Safari and Mail data.
* Rootkit checks (`HIDDEN-PID`, `HIDDEN-MODULE`, bind mounts) are heuristics that a kernel-level
  rootkit can defeat; treat a clean result as "nothing found", not "nothing there".
* `nfx-webshell` and the suspicious-command regex trade precision for recall. Tune
  `NFX_SUSP_RE` in `lib/nfx-common.sh` and `data/suid-baseline.txt` to your environment.
* Tested on Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 (bash 5) and written against the bash 3.2 / BSD userland on
  macOS; `tests/smoke.sh` runs every tool on the current host and should be run on each
  platform you deploy to.
